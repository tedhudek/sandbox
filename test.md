# Test File

This file is for testing per-line commenting.

You can do per-line comments that are associated with a commit, or with a pull request.

To comment on an older line, copy a link to that line and then paste the link into a commit comment.

Or use blame to find the commit where the line was added, and add the comment to that commit.

If commenting on a PR, the reviewer can approve or request changes from the PR.  After the submitter makes changes, GitHub shows the reviewer only changes since the most recent review.

Let's add another line.

One last line here.
