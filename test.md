# Test File

This file is for testing per-line commenting.

* You can do per-line comments that are associated with a commit, or with a pull request.
* To comment on an older line, copy a link to that line and then paste the link into a commit comment.
* Or use blame to find the commit where the line was added, and add the comment to that commit.

If commenting on a PR, the reviewer can approve or request changes from the PR.  After the submitter makes changes, GitHub shows the reviewer only changes since the most recent review.
