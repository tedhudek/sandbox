* Inflection points. What changed? How did you get started with that?
* Can I join?
* What's your opinion?
* How does my request fit in your priority list?

5. Be a lifelong learner.

* Mentoring is great, at any stage of your career.
* Know your strengths, but also take time to work on opportunities for development.
