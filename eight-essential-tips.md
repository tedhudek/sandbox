# Seven Essential Tips for the Enlightened Tech Writer

In this talk, I'll give you seven essential tips that will help you become a more effective tech writer. These are core principles that have guided me during almost two decades in the business.
At the end, I'll toss in a tiny but mighty bonus tip, and then I'll tell you a story. Ready? Here we go.

1. Just ask.

* The idea for this talk started during the WTD hike in 2016, when Jacob Moses asked about my work. Later he asked me to be a guest on his podcast to discuss how to future proof yourself as a tech writer. That interview served as the foundation for this talk.
* I asked three times to give this talk. First I asked the WTD organizers if I could give a talk. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. They said no, so then I asked how I could improve it. Very kindly, they gave me a few suggestions, so I retooled and pitched it again.
* When there's something you're waiting for someone to do, ask how it fits in their priority list. Seems trivial, right? But if choose your timing wisely and ask politely, you'll really increase the odds of a speedy turnaround.
* Ask for feedback. Not only do you get suggestions for improvements, but you let people know that you care about the quality of your work, and you care if they got what they needed from you. It shows people you're interested in taking care of them, and people love that.
* Show up and say nothing: I used to camp out in the lounge of the feature team first thing in the morning. When they arrived, I always got plenty of serendipitous encounters.  People would come up frequently and say something like "Seeing you reminds me, I'd been meaning to tell you about xyz."
* Ask how did you get started with that?

2. Listen. In 2016, when I was last on stage here, I told you about MS's initial foray into open source publishing. If you had suggested to me five years ago that we chuck all of our structured XML out the window, convert all of our docs to souped up text files and share them on a third party website, I would have said you're nuts.
But that's exactly what we did, and we did it in order to be able to listen to customers.  Microsoft's whole doc strategy the last couple years has been built around listening. We dumped MSDN with its crusty old infrastructure, and we replaced it with a collaborative doc platform that empowers customers to give us feedback and propose changes. And we empowered writers to publish instantly.
Anyone with a GitHub account can open an issue on our repo, right from the doc page. We back this up with data to inform content decisions, helping us figure out what customers need and what they don't. Quality is defined by customers, not us, and we provide content to them where they are, on GitHub, in social media, on mobile.
Think of each thing as a conversation with one person, even if it's an issue on GitHub, think of it as a phone call or an email where you are trying to help one person.

3. Practice storytelling. This tip is a global one. It applies to all professions. See Lincoln, Abraham. Whatever culture you're in, people crave stories. This means that storytelling is one of the most valuable skills you can learn. Start with the 7 elements of a story, which are:
    1. Once upon a time...
    2. And every day...
    3. Until one day...
    4. And because of this...
    5. And because of this...
    6. Until finally...
    7. And ever since that day...

<!--Lincoln-->

4. Create minimum content. As writers, we're fighting for limited attention cycles. To be successful, we need to create the least amount of content that gets the job done. Any more is too much.  At Microsoft, we spent decades building up tons of dev docs and technical content. In the last six months, we've torn down one and a half million pages of old content, with more on the way. The new way we work is enabled by the new collaborative toolchain. Once you have a minimal lump of clay, start collaborating on it. Once it's viable, publish it. Improve it in the public view, with the input of your customers. They'll tell you loud and clear if something doesn't work. Get the content out fast and get customers going.
"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." -- Antoine de Saint-Exupery

5. Own your stuff. As tech writers, sometimes we feel like we are at the end of the chain. But here's the real truth: you own a chunk of docs just like a developer owns a chunk of code. When it comes to your docs, you make the final decisions.  Sure, you're going to ask a bunch of people for feedback and buyoff on your docs. But a writer asking "should the docs say x or y" is like a reporter asking "should the story say x or y." Be accountable. Ask for input, own the output.

6. Be a lifelong learner. Be curious. Challenge yourself to wade into new waters. Have a preferred super tool for automating stuff.  For me, it's PowerShell and Python. Learn the tools your customers use. Learn by incremental doing. After you learn it, teach it to others. As MS, we do mentoring, which is a powerful conduit for two-way knowledge exchange.  Learn by incremental doing. Start with baby steps. set time and place to start. make some baby steps. have a review buddy/social obligation.

7. Say yes. Seize opportunities, don't wait to work to be assigned to you, stand up and grab opportunities. Cultivate an all-in mindset.

A tiny but mighty bonus tip: Give praise. This only takes a couple minutes, but it's incredible how many people don't do it. Try it and you will discover the highest benefit to cost ratio you'll ever see. For example, we thank people for every pull request we receive.

To close, I have a fictional story for you, but if you pay close attention, you might just recognize yourself. Once upon a time, there was a technical writer who had said yes to a very challenging assignment. Every day, she would bang her head on specs and headers and try to figure out how to document the feature. Every day, the doc wouldn't get done and she would go home frustrated. This went on day after day. One day, when she was walking to work and looking at the flowers, she had an idea. When she got to her office, she emailed her feature team and asked for input where she was blocked. And because of this, she was able to write some minimal content. She shared the draft internally and started collaborating on it further. And because of this, she got great feedback from the feature team. She listened closely to their feedback and then made the final decisions how to present the information. Along the way, she taught herself enough Python to automate some parts of writing the API docs for the feature. Finally, the big day came and she published the doc to the live website. Ever since that day, customers have rated the content highly. What about our writer heroine? Due to the high strategic importance of the feature, she got a promotion. She made sure to thank all the people who helped make the project so successful. She feels satisfied and confident and she is ready to say yes to the next writing opportunity.

Let's review what she did. At the very beginning, she said yes to a challenging assignment. She asked for info. She listened to the response. She started with minimal content and collaborated. She owned her content, making final decisions. She taught herself a tool to be more efficient. She thanked her colleagues. And at the end, she found herself ready to say yes to the next project.

When you tell a story, start with appropriate context.
How many times has someone started telling you something and not provided the context? Or come into your office and started in the middle of the problem?
Think of Apple commercials that showed you how to use the iPhone. Ad as tutorial! Then they put up a web page with links to the apps shown. Think of Claude Hopkins, who created the demand for toothpaste.
Define the problem. Things were going great, and then... you hit this problem. Here's how to use our product to solve your problem! Just use the following steps.
When you speak with authenticity, you build brand trust and create a more human experience.
Tell your story on social media.

5. Corollary: own your product. As writers, we have a unique opportunity to bind the product together. Many times I have seen writers be the glue that ties dev to test, or test to customer. Our role spans disciplines, and puts us, as writers, in a unique position to spot issues and drive quality. Take ownership for the product experience as a whole, not just the docs. Think of it as your responsibility to provide feedback to other teams when you see something that's not right. Think of yourself as an investigative reporter. At MS, selfhosting is part of the culture, for products as well as internal tools.
