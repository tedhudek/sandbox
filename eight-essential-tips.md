# Seven Essential Tips for the Enlightened Tech Writer

Two years ago, I went on the WTD hike. During the hike, I met a young writer by the name of Jacob. Jacob started asking me about my work. He asked me many questions over the course of the conference. A few weeks after the conference I got an email from Jacob, asking me to be a guest on his podcast to discuss how to future proof yourself as a tech writer. That interview served as the foundation for this talk. Jacob was practicing the first tip I'm going to share with you today, which is:

1. Just ask.

* So I took a cue from Jacob. I took the podcast interview we did and built it into this talk. Then, last year, I submitted it as a proposal for this conference. Guess what? They said no. So I sent Eric an email and I asked how I could improve it. He was kind enough to give me a few suggestions, so I make some changes and asked again this year. After two proposals and one request for feedback, here I am.
* Here's another one. When there's something you're waiting for someone to do, ask how it fits in their priority list. It seems trivial, but if you choose your timing wisely and ask politely, you'll really increase the odds of a speedy turnaround.
* Ask for feedback. At Microsoft, we actually have a tool for requesting feedback. Requesting feedback is great, because not only are you getting suggestions for improvement, but you're also letting people know that you care about the quality of your work, and that you care if they got what they needed from you. It shows people you're interested in taking care of them, and people love that.
* Or, try this one. Show up and say nothing: I used to camp out in the lounge of the feature team first thing in the morning. They would come in, see me, and frequently they would say: "Seeing you reminds me, I'd been meaning to tell you about xyz."
* Ask how did you get started with that? This is one my favorite questions. You can learn a lot by finding out how something started. It must have been something big to cause someone to change their behavior.

2. Listen.

Last time I was on stage here, I told you about our shiny new collaborative doc platform. Over the last couple years, Microsoft's whole doc strategy has been built around how can we better listen to our customers. Listening is the purpose for which this new platform was built. In the two years since, it's gone from a newfangled contraption to an everyday tool. Every day, I look at issues from internal and external customers. I look at data to figure out what people are using and what they're not. My goal when I do this is to listen closely, but then to add value and reflect back to improve the product. For example, say a customer opens a GitHub issue describing a broken scenario. We can try to repro it, we can go to the feature team, get clarification, drive change upstream if need be. By being much better tuned in to the signals we're getting, we can be a lot more effective adding value to the product.

3. Create minimum content.

* As writers, we're fighting for limited attention cycles. To be successful, we need to create the least amount of content that gets the job done. Any more is too much. At Microsoft, we spent decades building up tons of dev docs and technical content. In the last six months, we've torn down over a million pages of old content, with more on the way. The new way we work is through a collaborative platform. So what does this mean for creating new content?
* It means that you start collaborating a lot sooner. Once you have something small and stable, something people can build on, invite stakeholders to make changes and updates. Once it's viable, publish it. Then continue the same cycle in the public view, with the input of your customers. They'll tell you loud and clear if something doesn't work. Get the content out fast and get customers going.
* "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." -- Antoine de Saint-Exupery

4. Own the experience.

* As tech writers, sometimes we feel like we are at the end of the chain. But here's the real truth: you own a chunk of docs just like a developer owns a chunk of code. Sure, you're going to ask a bunch of people for feedback and buyoff on your docs. But when it comes to your docs, you make the final decisions.  But Be accountable. Ask for input, own the output.

* You can also practice ownership with the product as a whole. You don't own all the parts, but as a writer, you're in a unique position to bind the product together. Writers are frequently the glue that ties dev to test, or test to customer. Our role spans disciplines, and this puts us, as writers, in a unique position *repeat* to spot issues and drive quality. Take ownership for the product experience as a whole, not just the docs. Think of yourself as an investigative reporter. At Microsoft, selfhosting is part of the culture, so everyone is encouraged to own the experience.

5. Be a lifelong learner. Be curious. Challenge yourself to wade into new waters. *story* Have a preferred super tool for automating stuff.  For me, it's PowerShell and Python. Ten years ago, I started noodling around with PowerShell to automate a simple task, and from that point on, every time I needed to query something or add metadata or *whatever*, I would take an extra moment and figure out how to do it in PowerShell. After a few hundred such times, I got pretty competent. So you can learn in little bursts.
* Teaching is also a great way to add value to your organization. So after you learn something cool, teach it to others.
* At Microsoft, we have a formal mentoring program. Mentoring is awesome, but what might surprise you about it is that it's a powerful conduit for two-way knowledge exchange. I frequently feel like I'm learning just as much, if not more, from my mentees than vice-versa.
* Know your strengths and where you have opportunities for development. Let me give you an example. My former manager always seemed completely at ease in front of groups, so one time I said to him, you really seem comfortable with public speaking. He shook his head and said he'd actually identified it as an opportunity for his own personal development, and had spent a year actively seeking out any and all opportunities that would force him to get up in front of a group and talk. And after that year, he had built the skill, and the result was the accomplished speaker that I saw.

opportunities
6. Say yes. Seize opportunities, don't wait to work to be assigned to you, stand up and grab opportunities. Cultivate a growth mindset. At Microsoft, we embrace growth mindset in a big way. One of the most powerful things we've been able to do as a result is release Windows once every six months, and get Insider builds out even faster. This is one of the biggest products on Earth. Long ago when we went from Windows XP to Windows Vista, it took five years! So from a fixed mindset, it seemed impossible, but we *retooled* our engineering systems from top to bottom and we made it happen because that's what our customers expect. Because we said yes to this opportunity, we can now get new features and updates out much faster to delight our customers and enable new business opportunities.

7. Use the power of storytelling. This tip is a global one. It applies to all professions. At Microsoft, when new program managers come onboard, they receive a welcome packet that contains a book called Resonate, which is about storytelling. Then they actually get storytelling training and learn how it can help them get better business results. Docs at Microsoft have also become much more story-oriented compared to fifteen years ago. It used to be that I documented features, but now I tell stories of how things fit together, which mirrors what has happened on the product side.
* Whatever company or culture you're part of, people crave stories. This means that storytelling is one of the most valuable skills you can learn.
 
A tiny but mighty bonus tip: Give praise. This only takes a couple minutes, but it's incredible how many people don't do it. Try it and you will discover the highest benefit to cost ratio you'll ever see. For example, we thank people for every pull request we receive.

To close, I have a fictional story for you, but if you pay close attention, you might just recognize yourself. Once upon a time, there was a technical writer who had just been hired at Supersoft, Inc. In her first few months on the job, she fixed small bugs and learned the product. She met with customer focus groups to understand how customers were using the product.
One day, her manager came into the team meeting and said there's a new scenario with high strategic importance, and asked for a volunteer to write the docs for it. Our writer felt a little nervous but said yes.

When she returned to her office, she started studying specs and headers. She developed a good understanding of the parts, but was having trouble putting together an end-to-end scenario. She realized she needed more information, so she requested a meeting with the developers, and brought a list of specific questions for them. This resulted in her learning some key facts that were not apparent in the specs.
She was able to combine her existing knowledge with the extra info to write up a draft scenario with minimal content.

She shared the draft internally and asked for feedback. As a result, she got great input from the team. She listened closely to their suggestions and then made the final decisions how to present the information. Along the way, she taught herself enough Python to automate some parts of writing the API docs to complete the scenario. Finally, the big day came and she published the doc to the live website. Ever since, customers have rated the content highly and showed higher levels of engagement with the product. She thanked all the people who helped make the project so successful. She also decided to teach her writing team some Python. 
She mentors a new writer on the team and *starts* by telling her success story and the lessons she learned from it.
Periodically, she reviews the customer feedback on her doc and makes updates as needed. She feels satisfied and confident and she is ready to say yes to the next writing opportunity.

Let's review what she did:
* First, she said yes to a challenging assignment.
* She *asked* to meet with the devs, and brought a list of questions for them.
* She listened to the team and her customers.
* She wrote minimal content and iterated on it with stakeholders.
* She asked for input, but owned the output.
* She grew her skills by teaching herself Python, and then taught it to her *team*.
* She mentored and used her story to educate.
* She thanked her colleagues.
* And at the end, she found herself ready to say yes to the next project.

When you tell a story, start with appropriate context.
How many times has someone started telling you something and not provided the context? Or come into your office and started in the middle of the problem?
Think of Apple commercials that showed you how to use the iPhone. Ad as tutorial! Then they put up a web page with links to the apps shown. Think of Claude Hopkins, who created the demand for toothpaste.
Define the problem. Things were going great, and then... you hit this problem. Here's how to use our product to solve your problem! Just use the following steps.
