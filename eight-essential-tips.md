# Essential Tips for the Enlightened Tech Writer

In this talk, I'll provide some essential tips that will help you become a more effective tech writer. These are core principles that have guided me during almost two decades in the business:

1. Ask and connect with people.

* The idea for this talk started during the WTD hike in 2016, when Jacob Moses asked about my work. Later he asked me to be a guest on his podcast to discuss how to future proof yourself as a tech writer. That interview served as the foundation for this talk.
* Then I asked the WTD organizers if I could give a talk. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. They said no the first time I proposed it, so I asked again, this time how I could improve it. They were kind enough to offer me some suggestions, so I retooled and pitched it again.
* When there's something you're waiting for someone to do, ask how it fits in their priority list. At first glance, this one seems trivial. But if you ask politely, and choose your timing, you'll increase the odds of a quick turnaround.
* Ask for feedback. Not only do you get suggestions for improvements, but you let people know that you care about the quality of your work, and you care if they got what they needed. It shows people you're interested in taking care of them, and people love that.
* Show up and say nothing: I used to camp out in the lounge of the feature team first thing in the morning. When they arrived, I always got plenty of serendipitous encounters.  People would come up frequently and say something like "That reminds me, I'd been meaning to tell you about xyz."
* Ask how did you get started with that?

2. Listen. In 2016, when I was last on stage here, I told you about MS's initial foray into open source publishing. If you had told me five years ago that we would chuck all of our structured XML out the window, convert all of our docs to souped up text files, and shared them on a third party website, I would have said that's a crazy idea. But that's exactly what we did, and we did it in order to be able to listen to customers.  Our whole doc strategy the last couple years has been built around listening. We dumped MSDN with all of its wheezing infrastructure, and we replaced it with a collaborative docs platform that empowers customers to give us feedback and propose changes, with writers empowered to publish instantly. Anyone with a GitHub account can open an issue on our repo, right from the doc page. We back this up with data to inform content decisions, helping us figure out what customers need and what they don't. Quality is defined by customers, not us, and we provide content to them where they are, on GitHub, in social media, or on mobile. Think of each thing as a conversation with one person, even if it's an issue on GitHub, think of it as a phone call or an email when you are trying to help one person.

3. Tell stories.  This applies to everything you do.  Even your automatic email reply.  When you tell a story, adjust how you begin for the audience, providing an appropriate level of introduction for the context. How many times has someone started a technical story with you and not provided the context? Or come into your office and started in the middle of the problem? Storytelling is one of the most important skills you can learn. It binds us together as humans. Focus on authenticity, build brand trust and create a more human experience.

4. Own your stuff. As tech writers, sometimes we feel like we are at the end of the chain. But here's the real truth - you own a chunk of docs just like a developer owns a chunk of code. When it comes to your docs, you make the final decisions.  Sure, you're going to ask a bunch of people for feedback and buyoff on your docs. But a writer asking "should the docs say x or y" is like a reporter asking "should the story say x or y." Be accountable. Embrace the ownership mantra: Ask for input, own the output.

5. Own your product. As writers, we have a unique opportunity to bind the product together. Take ownership for the product experience as a whole. Think of it as your responsibility to provide feedback to other teams when you see something that's not right. Think of yourself as an investigative reporter. At MS, selfhosting is part of the culture, for products as well as internal tools.

6. Minimum content. We modern humans are overwhelmed. Day in and day out we face a constant stream of news, social media updates, alerts, pings, pokes, and more. As writers, we're fighting for limited attention cycles. To be successful, we need to create the least amount of content that gets the job done. Any more is too much.  Take Microsoft for example.  We spent decades building up tons of dev docs and technical content. It's accumulated over the years and now, just in the last six months, we have torn down 1.5 million pages from our old properties, and there's more on the way. Get the content out fast and get customers going. Once you have a minimal lump of clay, start collaborating on it. Once it's viable, publish it and then improve it in the public view. When you're listening to your customers, they'll tell you loud and clear if it doesn't work. Choose the most important content sets to curate an e2e experience.  "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." -- Antoine de Saint-Exupery

7. Be a lifelong learner. Be curious. Challenge yourself to wade into new waters. Help others along their journey. Consider mentoring as a powerful conduit for two-way knowledge exchange. Have a preferred super tool for automating stuff.  (PowerShell, Python) Learn the tools your customers use. Learn by incremental doing. Seize opportunities, don't wait to work to be assigned to you, stand up and grab opportunities. Cultivate an all-in mindset. Say yes.

A tiny but mighty bonus tip: Give praise. This only takes a couple minutes, but it's incredible how many people don't do it. Try it and you will discover the highest benefit to cost ratio you'll ever see. For example, we thank people for every pull request we receive.
