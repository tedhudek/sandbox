# Seven Essential Tips for the Enlightened Tech Writer

Two years ago, I went on the WTD hike. During the hike, I met a young writer by the name of Jacob. Jacob started asking me about my work. He asked me many questions over the course of the conference. A few weeks after the conference I got an email from Jacob, asking me another question - if I'd be a guest on his podcast to discuss how to future proof yourself as a tech writer. That interview served as the foundation for this talk. Jacob was practicing the first tip I'm going to share with you today, which is:

1. Just ask.

* So I took a cue from Jacob. I turned the podcast interview into a talk and asked Write the Docs if I could present. Guess what? They said no. So I asked how I could improve it. I made some changes and asked again this year. After two proposals and one request for feedback, here I am.
* Ask people how your request fits in their priority list. Just a high level ping can really increase the odds of a speedy turnaround.
* Ask for feedback. At Microsoft, we actually have a tool for requesting feedback. Requesting feedback is great, because not only are you getting suggestions for improvement, but you're also letting people know that you care about the quality of your work, and that you care if they got what they needed from you. Show people you're interested in taking care of them! People love that.
* Ask by being in the right place at the right time. I used to camp out in the lounge of the feature team first thing in the morning. They would come in, see me, and frequently they would say: "Seeing you reminds me, I'd been meaning to tell you about some super important thing."
* Ask how did you get started with that? Somebody was doing something different previously, then one day they decided to start doing something new. What was the inflection point that caused them to change their behavior? You can learn a lot by finding out how something started.

2. Listen for intent.

Recently, we made some big changes to the way we organize our API docs. We spent months working on the new layout and really tried to optimize it for our developers. Not long after the change, we got email from one of our most influential developers that was a detailed rant. He sent us screenshots with red circles, highlighted text, and many specifics. He missed the old model and wanted it back. At first glance, it looked like he wanted us to completely overhaul our new system. But we took the time to really drill down on the feedback to figure out what he actually wanted. As a result, we were able to come up with a small number of low-cost changes we could make that addressed his feedback and made the new system that much better.

The principle here is listen for intent. First, seek to understand. Then you can add value.

A lot of times, when you come into a situation as a writer, things are unclear. Someone bursts into your office and starts in the middle of the problem. Or you get feedback that's unclear.  Maybe you're in a meeting and you're unclear about something being discussed. Ask questions to better understand. In Stephen Covey's book The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, understand first is one of the principles.

Last time I was on stage here, I told you about our shiny new collaborative doc platform. Over the last couple years, Microsoft's whole doc strategy has been built around how can we better listen to our customers. Listening is the purpose for which this new platform was built. In the two years since, it's gone from a newfangled contraption to an everyday tool. Every day, I look at issues from internal and external customers. I look at data to figure out what people are using and what they're not. My goal when I do this is to listen closely, and then to add value and reflect back to improve the product. For example, say a customer opens a GitHub issue describing a broken scenario. We can try to repro it, we can go to the feature team, get clarification, drive change upstream if need be. But it all starts with listening. By being better tuned in to the signals we're getting, we're a lot more effective adding value to the product.

3. Create the minimum thing.

Frequently in technical docs, there are a few key points, crucial things that you need to do. How many times have you had to slog through a long page to find the key thing and there's one sentence, one key sentence, way down somewhere. Don't put people through that. If you make your reader wade through a bunch of extraneous words to get to the key thing, you have failed!
* Instead, create the least amount of content that gets the job done. At Microsoft, we spent decades building up tons of dev docs and technical content. In the last six months, we've torn down millions of pages of old content. Now we work exclusively using a collaborative doc platform.
* This means that everybody can pitch in a lot sooner. My challenge as a writer is to try to write the basic nugget of truth that tells people how to do the thing. Write up a draft and invite people to improve it with you.
I like to think of Twitter as an example of how you can communicate a core idea in minimal words. It's a fun thought exercise to try to boil an idea down to a tweet. Of course, you lose a lot of nuance, but it's surprising how often you can do this. It's why texting is so effective. There's a hashtag #explainafilmplotbadly. So give your docs the Twitter test. Figure out the key things your reader needs to know, and get them there fast.

4. Own the experience.

* As tech writers, sometimes we feel like we are at the end of the chain. This is something that took me a while to get when I started my career. I felt like the feature team owned all the things. It was tempting to take the spec and beautify it, and risky to make changes. But if you do that, you're not adding any value. The real truth is this: you own a chunk of docs just like a developer owns a chunk of code. Figure out what you control, and figure out where you're trying to go with it. Sure, you're going to ask a bunch of people for feedback and buyoff on your docs. But when it comes to your docs, you make the final decisions. Be accountable. Ask for input, own the output.
* You can also practice ownership with the product as a whole. You don't own all the parts, but as a writer, you're in a unique position to bind the product together. Writers are frequently the bridge that connects dev to test, or test to customer. Our role spans disciplines, and this gives us, as writers, a great opportunity to spot issues and drive quality. Take ownership for the product experience as a whole, not just the docs. At Microsoft, selfhosting is part of the culture, so everyone is encouraged to own the experience.

5. Be a lifelong learner. Be curious. Challenge yourself to wade into new waters. *story* Have a preferred super tool for automating stuff.  For me, it's PowerShell and Python. Ten years ago, I started noodling around with PowerShell to automate a simple task, and from that point on, every time I needed to query something or add metadata or *whatever*, I would take an extra moment and figure out how to do it in PowerShell. After a few hundred such times, I got pretty competent. So you can learn in little bursts.
* Teaching is also a great way to add value to your organization. So after you learn something cool, teach it to others.
* At Microsoft, we have a formal mentoring program. Mentoring is awesome, but what might surprise you about it is that it's a powerful conduit for two-way knowledge exchange. I frequently feel like I'm learning just as much, if not more, from my mentees than vice-versa.
* Know your strengths and where you have opportunities for development. Let me give you an example. My former manager always seemed completely at ease in front of groups, so one time I said to him, you really seem comfortable with public speaking. He shook his head and said he'd actually identified it as an opportunity for his own personal development, and had spent a year actively seeking out any and all opportunities that would force him to get up in front of a group and talk. And after that year, he had built the skill, and the result was the accomplished speaker that I saw.

6. How many of you have been in this situation? You're in a team meeting and your manager says, we need a volunteer to work on a new feature. Your first reaction is probably to shrink back in your seat and be invisible. But, within bounds of course, I've found that such moments can lead to great new opportunities. So my advice to you is: opt in. Seize opportunities, don't wait to work to be assigned to you, stand up and grab opportunities.

7. Use the power of storytelling. This tip is a global one. It applies to all professions. At Microsoft, when new program managers come onboard, they receive a welcome packet that contains a book called Resonate, which is about storytelling. Then they actually get storytelling training and learn how it can help them get better business results. Docs at Microsoft have also become much more story-oriented compared to fifteen years ago. It used to be that I documented features, but now I tell stories of how things fit together, which mirrors what has happened on the product side.
* Whatever company or culture you're part of, people crave stories. This means that storytelling is one of the most valuable skills you can learn.
 
To close, I have a fictional story for you, but if you pay close attention, you might just recognize yourself.

Once upon a time, there was a technical writer who had just been hired at Supersoft, Inc. In her first few months on the job, she fixed small bugs and learned the product. She met with customer focus groups to understand how customers were using the product.
One day, her manager came into the team meeting and said there's a new scenario with high strategic importance, and asked for a volunteer to write the docs for it. Our writer felt a little nervous but said yes.

When she returned to her office, she started studying specs and headers. She developed a good understanding of the parts, but was having trouble putting together an end-to-end scenario. She realized she needed more information, so she requested a meeting with the developers, and brought a list of specific questions for them. This resulted in her learning some key facts that were not apparent in the specs.
She was able to combine her existing knowledge with the extra info to write up a draft scenario with minimal content.

She shared the draft internally and asked for feedback. As a result, she got great input from the team. She listened closely to their suggestions and then made the final decisions how to present the information. Along the way, she taught herself enough Python to automate some parts of writing the API docs to complete the scenario. Finally, the big day came and she published the doc to the live website. Ever since, customers have rated the content highly and showed higher levels of engagement with the product. She thanked all the people who helped make the project so successful. She also decided to teach her writing team some Python. 
She mentors a new writer on the team and *starts* by telling her success story and the lessons she learned from it.
Periodically, she reviews the customer feedback on her doc and makes updates as needed. She feels satisfied and confident and she is ready to say yes to the next writing opportunity.

Let's review what she did:
* First, she said yes to a challenging assignment.
* She *asked* to meet with the devs, and brought a list of questions for them.
* She listened to the team and her customers.
* She wrote minimal content and iterated on it with stakeholders.
* She asked for input, but owned the output.
* She grew her skills by teaching herself Python, and then taught it to her *team*.
* She mentored and used her story to educate.
* She thanked her colleagues.
* And at the end, she found herself ready to say yes to the next project.

A tiny but mighty bonus tip: Give praise. This only takes a couple minutes, but it's incredible how many people don't do it. Try it and you will discover the highest benefit to cost ratio you'll ever see. For example, we thank people for every pull request we receive.

Let me show you how easy it is to say thanks. Ready? Thanks for listening, I hope these tips help you as continue in your career. Here's a resource slide with some extra goodies to check out.

When you tell a story, start with appropriate context.
How many times has someone started telling you something and not provided the context? Or come into your office and started in the middle of the problem?
Think of Apple commercials that showed you how to use the iPhone. Ad as tutorial! Then they put up a web page with links to the apps shown. Think of Claude Hopkins, who created the demand for toothpaste.

current state, new challenge, retool/adjust, triumph, then new state.
was: got assignment, worked hard to no avail until one day mailed team, because of this success, more success, until published.
what if: was a writer, did normal stuff until one day new thing announced, then retooled and adjusted, until success
was the assignment in 1 or 3? if 1, then what's 3? mailed team?

Cultivate a growth mindset. At Microsoft, we embrace growth mindset in a big way.
One of the most powerful things we've been able to do as a result is release Windows once every six months, and get Insider builds out even faster. This is one of the biggest products on Earth. Long ago when we went from Windows XP to Windows Vista, it took five years! So from a fixed mindset, it seemed impossible, but we *retooled* our engineering systems from top to bottom and we made it happen because that's what our customers expect.
