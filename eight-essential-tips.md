# Essential Tips for the Enlightened Tech Writer

In this talk, I'll provide some essential tips that will help you become a more effective tech writer. These are core principles that have guided me during almost two decades in the business:

1. Put yourself in the field of play. Ask and connect with people.

* The idea for this talk started during the WTD hike in 2016, when Jacob Moses started asking about my work. Later he asked me to be a guest on his podcast to discuss how to future proof yourself as a tech writer. That interview served as the foundation for this talk.
* Then I asked the WTD organizers if I could give a talk. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. They actually said no the first time I proposed it, so I put on my asking cap again and asked how I could improve it. They were kind enough to offer me some suggestions, so I retooled and pitched it again.
* When there's something you're waiting for someone to do, ask how it fits in their priority list. At first glance, this one seems trivial. But if you ask politely, and choose your timing, you'll increase the odds of a quick turnaround.
* Ask for feedback. Not only do you get suggestions for improvements, but you let people know that you care about the quality of your work, and you care if they got what they needed. It shows people you're interested in taking care of them, and people love that.
* Show up and say nothing: I used to camp out in the lounge of the feature team when they came arrived in the morning, and got plenty of serendipitous encounters.  People would come up and frequently say something like "That reminds me, I'd been meaning to tell you about xyz."

2. Listen.  As writers, we need to understand where customers are in their journey and where they need help. At MS, we have a collaborative docs platform that empowers customers to give us feedback and propose changes, with a vastly shorter loop. We use data to inform content decisions, what customers need, and what they don't. Quality is defined by customers not us, and we provide content to them where they are, for example on GitHub, or in relevant social media, or optimizing delivery for mobile.

3. Tell stories.  This applies to everything you do.  Even your automatic email reply.  When you tell a story, adjust how you begin for the audience, providing an appropriate level of introduction for the context. How many times has someone started a technical story with you and not provided the context? Storytelling is one of the most important skills you can learn. It binds us together as humans. Focus on authenticity, build brand trust and create a more human experience. Choose the most important content sets to curate e2e experience.

4. Own your stuff. As tech writers, sometimes we feel like we are at the end of the chain. But we're not - you own a chunk of docs just like a developer owns a chunk of code. When it comes to your docs, you make the final decisions.  Sure, you're going to ask a bunch of people for feedback and even signoff on your docs. But a writer asking "should the docs say x or y" is like a reporter asking "should the story say x or y." Ask for input, own the output.

5. Minimum content. We modern humans are overwhelmed. Day in and day out we face a constant stream of news, social media updates, alerts, pings, pokes, and more. We're fighting for attention, and customers have precious little to give. As writers, we need to create the least amount of content that gets the job done. Any more is too much.  Take Microsoft for example.  We've spent decades building up lots of dev docs and technical content. It's accumulated over the years and now, we've spent the last six months tearing down 100k topics and putting them in legacy. Our most important job is to give customers what they need without overwhelming them. The solution is to provide the least amount of content that ensures success for your customers. Get the content out fast and get customers going. "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." -- Antoine de Saint-Exupery

6. Be a lifelong learner. I said this before, but be curious. Challenge yourself to wade into new waters and don't let complacency take hold. Not only help yourself, but help others along their journey. Consider mentoring as a powerful conduit for two-way knowledge exchange. Have a preferred super tool for automating stuff.  (PowerShell, Python) Learn the tools your customers use. Learn by incremental doing. Seize opportunities, don't wait to work to be assigned to you, stand up and grab opportunities. Cultivate an all-in mindset. Say yes.

A tiny but mighty bonus tip: Give praise. This usually takes a couple minutes, but it's incredible how many people don't do it. Try it and you will discover the highest benefit to cost ratio you'll ever see. For example, we thank people for every pull request we receive.

<!--Also take ownership for the product experience as a whole. It is our responsibility to provide feedback to others teams when we see something that's not right. Think of yourself as an investigative reporter. We have a unique opportunity as writers to bind the product together. Ask how did you get started with that?-->
