# Seven Essential Tips for the Enlightened Tech Writer

Two years ago, I went on the WTD hike. During the hike, I met a young writer by the name of Jacob. Jacob started asking me about my work. He asked me many questions over the course of the conference. A few weeks after the conference I got an email from Jacob, asking me to be a guest on his podcast to discuss how to future proof yourself as a tech writer. That interview served as the foundation for this talk. Jacob was practicing the first tip I'm going to share with you today, which is...

1. Just ask.

* So I took a cue from Jacob and asked the WTD organizers if I could give a talk. Guess what? They said no. So then I asked how I could improve it. Eric was kind enough to give me a few suggestions, so I retooled and pitched it again. That's three times I asked, and here I am.
* When there's something you're waiting for someone to do, ask how it fits in their priority list. Seems trivial, right? But if choose your timing wisely and ask politely, you'll really increase the odds of a speedy turnaround.
* Ask for feedback. Not only do you get suggestions for improvements, but you let people know that you care about the quality of your work, and you care if they got what they needed from you. It shows people you're interested in taking care of them, and people love that.
* Or, show up and say nothing: I used to camp out in the lounge of the feature team. They would come in first thing in the morning, see me, and say: "Seeing you reminds me, I'd been meaning to tell you about xyz."
* Ask how did you get started with that?

2. Listen.

Last time I was on stage here, I told you about our shiny new collaborative doc platform. Microsoft's doc strategy over the last couple years has been entirely built around how can we listen better to our customers, and that's the spirit in which this new platform was built. In the two years since, it's gone from a newfangled contraption to an everyday tool. Every day, I look at issues from internal and external customers. I look at data to figure out what people are using and what they're not. But here's the thing about it. You can only help one person at a time. Try to give it your attention in the same way you would listen to someone who stopped by your office with a question. Same applies to when you meet with your feature teams. It requires some mental jujitsu sometimes, but the goal is to shelve your agenda and listen for intent. What does the person want and how can you help?

3. Create minimum content.

* As writers, we're fighting for limited attention cycles. To be successful, we need to create the least amount of content that gets the job done. Any more is too much. At Microsoft, we spent decades building up tons of dev docs and technical content. In the last six months, we've torn down over a million pages of old content, with more on the way. The new way we work is through a collaborative platform. So what does this mean for creating new content?
* It means that you start collaborating a lot sooner. Once you have a minimal lump of clay, invite stakeholders to make changes and updates. Once it's viable, publish it. Then continue the same cycle in the public view, with the input of your customers. They'll tell you loud and clear if something doesn't work. Get the content out fast and get customers going.
* "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." -- Antoine de Saint-Exupery

4. Own the experience.

* As tech writers, sometimes we feel like we are at the end of the chain. But here's the real truth: you own a chunk of docs just like a developer owns a chunk of code. When it comes to your docs, you make the final decisions.  Sure, you're going to ask a bunch of people for feedback and buyoff on your docs. But a writer asking "should the docs say x or y" is like a reporter asking "should the story say x or y." Be accountable. Ask for input, own the output.
* You can also practice ownership with the product as a whole. You don't own all the parts, but as a writer, you're in a unique position to bind the product together. Writers are frequently the glue that ties dev to test, or test to customer. Our role spans disciplines, and puts us, as writers, in a unique position to spot issues and drive quality. Take ownership for the product experience as a whole, not just the docs. Think of yourself as an investigative reporter. At MS, selfhosting is part of the culture, for products as well as internal tools.

5. Be a lifelong learner. Be curious. Challenge yourself to wade into new waters. Have a preferred super tool for automating stuff.  For me, it's PowerShell and Python. Learn the tools your customers use. Learn by incremental doing. After you learn it, teach it to others. As MS, we do mentoring, which is a powerful conduit for two-way knowledge exchange.  Learn by incremental doing. Start with baby steps. set time and place to start. make some baby steps. have a review buddy/social obligation.
Know your strengths and where you need to grow. Opportunities for development. Keep your skill fresh and current, learn language of customers.

6. Say yes. Seize opportunities, don't wait to work to be assigned to you, stand up and grab opportunities. Cultivate a growth mindset. We've been practicing it internally at MS. One of the most powerful things we've been able to do as a result is release Windows once every six months, one of the biggest products on Earth and we said yes to a more customer-focused release schedule that they expect.

7. First? Use the power of storytelling. This tip is a global one. It applies to all professions. At MS, when new program managers come onboard, they receive a welcome packet that contains a book called Resonate, which is about storytelling. Then they actually get storytelling training and how it can help them get business results. Abraham Lincoln was a master storyteller who used the parable model to great effect. Whatever culture you're in, people crave stories. This means that storytelling is one of the most valuable skills you can learn. <!--introduce where this came from?-->One way to think of story framework is with the following seven elements:
    1. Once upon a time...
    2. And every day...
    3. Until one day...
    4. And because of this...
    5. And because of this...
    6. Until finally...
    7. And ever since that day...

A tiny but mighty bonus tip: Give praise. This only takes a couple minutes, but it's incredible how many people don't do it. Try it and you will discover the highest benefit to cost ratio you'll ever see. For example, we thank people for every pull request we receive.

To close, I have a fictional story for you, but if you pay close attention, you might just recognize yourself. Once upon a time, there was a technical writer who had said yes to a very challenging assignment. listened to customers and found out what they need, write scenario bare min, take it back to team and iterate on it, thank ppl, listen again, Every day, she would bang her head on specs and headers and try to figure out how to document the scenario. Every day, the doc wouldn't get done and she would go home frustrated. This went on day after day. One day, when she was walking to work and looking at the flowers, she had an idea. When she got to her office, she emailed her feature team and asked for input where she was blocked. And because of this, she was able to write some minimal content. She shared the draft internally and started collaborating on it further. And because of this, she got great feedback from the feature team. She listened closely to their feedback and then made the final decisions how to present the information. Along the way, she taught herself enough Python to automate some parts of writing the API docs for the feature. Finally, the big day came and she published the doc to the live website. Ever since that day, customers have rated the content highly. What about our writer heroine? Due to the high strategic importance of the feature, she found customers are better able to use our products. She made sure to thank all the people who helped make the project so successful. She feels satisfied and confident and she is ready to say yes to the next writing opportunity.

Let's review what she did. At the very beginning, she said yes to a challenging assignment. She asked for info. She listened to the response. She started with minimal content and collaborated. She owned her content, making final decisions. She taught herself a tool to be more efficient. She thanked her colleagues. And at the end, she found herself ready to say yes to the next project.

When you tell a story, start with appropriate context.
How many times has someone started telling you something and not provided the context? Or come into your office and started in the middle of the problem?
Think of Apple commercials that showed you how to use the iPhone. Ad as tutorial! Then they put up a web page with links to the apps shown. Think of Claude Hopkins, who created the demand for toothpaste.
Define the problem. Things were going great, and then... you hit this problem. Here's how to use our product to solve your problem! Just use the following steps.
When you speak with authenticity, you build brand trust and create a more human experience.
