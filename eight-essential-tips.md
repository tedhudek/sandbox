# Seven Essential Tips for the Enlightened Tech Writer

1. Use the power of storytelling. At Microsoft, when new program managers come onboard, they receive a welcome packet that contains a book called Resonate, which is about storytelling. Then they actually get storytelling training and how it can help them get business results. Abraham Lincoln was a master storyteller who used the parable model to great effect. Whatever culture you're in, people crave stories. This means that storytelling is one of the most valuable skills you can learn.
 
In the world of documentation, we're natural storytellers, we tell the story of the product. As writers, we're in a unique position to tell the story of the business.

Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a technical writer who was new at Supersoft (Contoso?), Inc. In her first few months on the job, she fixed small bugs and learned the product. She met with customer focus groups to understand key scenarios.
One day, her manager came into the team meeting and said there's a big new scenario with high strategic importance. Who can take the job? She felt a little nervous but said yes.

When she returned to her office, she started putting together knowledge but struggled to create e2e scenario. She realized he needed more information, so she asked to join a key meeting, which resulted in her learning some key facts that were not apparent in the specs.
She was able to use her existing knowledge of customer usage patterns and combine it with the extra info to write up a draft scenario with minimal content.

She shared the draft internally and asked for feedback. And because of this, she got great input from the team. She listened closely to their suggestions and then made the final decisions how to present the information. Along the way, she taught herself enough Python to automate some parts of writing the API docs to complete the scenario. Finally, the big day came and she published the doc to the live website. Ever since that day, customers have rated the content highly. The verbatims indicate that customers are succeeding with this key scenario, and as a result they're more deeply engaged with the product. She made sure to thank all the people who helped make the project so successful. She also decided to teach her writing team some Python. Periodically, she review the customer feedback on her doc and updates it as needed. She feels satisfied and confident and she is ready to say yes to the next writing opportunity.

Two years ago, I went on the WTD hike. During the hike, I met a young writer by the name of Jacob. Jacob started asking me about my work. He asked me many questions over the course of the conference. A few weeks after the conference I got an email from Jacob, asking me to be a guest on his podcast to discuss how to future proof yourself as a tech writer. That interview served as the foundation for this talk. Jacob was practicing the first tip I'm going to share with you today, which is...

2. Just ask.

* So I took a cue from Jacob and asked the WTD organizers if I could give a talk. Guess what? They said no. So then I asked how I could improve it. They were kind enough to give me a few suggestions, so I retooled and pitched it again. So I asked three times, and here I am.
* Here's another one. When there's something you're waiting for someone to do, ask how it fits in their priority list. It seems trivial, but if choose your timing wisely and ask politely, you'll really increase the odds of a speedy turnaround.
* Ask for feedback. At Microsoft, we actually have a tool for requesting feedback. Asking feedback is great, because not only are you getting suggestions for improvement, but you're also letting people know that you care about the quality of your work, and you care if they got what they needed from you. It shows people you're interested in taking care of them, and people love that.
* Or, try this one. Show up and say nothing: I used to camp out in the lounge of the feature team first thing in the morning. They would come in see me, and frequently they would say: "Seeing you reminds me, I'd been meaning to tell you about xyz."
* One last suggestion for asking. Ask how did you get started with that? This is one my favorite questions. You can learn a lot by finding out how something started. In other words, what caused a change in behavior?

3. Listen.

Last time I was on stage here, I told you about our shiny new collaborative doc platform. Microsoft's doc strategy over the last couple years has been entirely built around how can we listen better to our customers, and that's the spirit in which this new platform was built. In the two years since, it's gone from a newfangled contraption to an everyday tool. Every day, I look at issues from internal and external customers. I look at data to figure out what people are using and what they're not. My goal when I do this is to listen closely, but then to add value and reflect back to improve the product. For example, say a customer opens a GitHub issue describing a broken scenario. We can try to repro it, we can go to the feature team, get clarification, drive change upstream if need be. By being much better tuned in to the signals we're getting, we can be a lot more effective adding value to the product.

4. Create minimum content.

* As writers, we're fighting for limited attention cycles. To be successful, we need to create the least amount of content that gets the job done. Any more is too much. At Microsoft, we spent decades building up tons of dev docs and technical content. In the last six months, we've torn down over a million pages of old content, with more on the way. The new way we work is through a collaborative platform. So what does this mean for creating new content?
* It means that you start collaborating a lot sooner. Once you have a minimal lump of clay, invite stakeholders to make changes and updates. Once it's viable, publish it. Then continue the same cycle in the public view, with the input of your customers. They'll tell you loud and clear if something doesn't work. Get the content out fast and get customers going.
* "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." -- Antoine de Saint-Exupery

something to build on

5. Own the experience.

* As tech writers, sometimes we feel like we are at the end of the chain. But here's the real truth: you own a chunk of docs just like a developer owns a chunk of code. Sure, you're going to ask a bunch of people for feedback and buyoff on your docs. But when it comes to your docs, you make the final decisions.  But Be accountable. Ask for input, own the output.
* You can also practice ownership with the product as a whole. You don't own all the parts, but as a writer, you're in a unique position to bind the product together. Writers are frequently the glue that ties dev to test, or test to customer. Our role spans disciplines, and this puts us, as writers, in a unique position to spot issues and drive quality. Take ownership for the product experience as a whole, not just the docs. Think of yourself as an investigative reporter. At Microsoft, selfhosting is part of the culture, so everyone is encouraged to own the experience.

6. Be a lifelong learner. Be curious. Challenge yourself to wade into new waters. Have a preferred super tool for automating stuff.  For me, it's PowerShell and Python. I started noodling around with PowerShell ten years ago to automate a simple task, and from that point on, every time I needed to query something or add metadata or whatever, I would take an extra moment and figure out how to do it in PowerShell. After a few hundred such times, I got pretty competent. So you can learn in little bursts.
* Teaching is also a great way to add value to your organization. So after you learn something cool, teach it to others.
* At Microsoft, we have a formal mentoring program. Mentoring is awesome, but what might surprise you about it is that it's a powerful conduit for two-way knowledge exchange. I frequently feel like I'm learning just as much, if not more, from my mentees than vice-versa.
* Know your strengths and where you have opportunities for development. Let me give you an example. My former manager always seemed completely at ease in front of groups, so one time I told him you really seem comfortable with public speaking. He shook his head and said he'd actually identified it as an opportunity for his own personal development, and had spent a year actively seeking out any and all opportunities that would force him to get up in front of a group and talk. And after that year, he had built the skill, and the result was the polished speaker that I saw.

7. Say yes. Seize opportunities, don't wait to work to be assigned to you, stand up and grab opportunities. Cultivate a growth mindset. At Microsoft, we embrace growth mindset in a big way. One of the most powerful things we've been able to do as a result is release Windows once every six months, and get Insider builds out even faster. This is one of the biggest products on Earth. Long ago when we went from Windows XP to Windows Vista, it took five years! So from a fixed mindset, it seemed impossible, but we retooled our engineering systems from top to bottom and we made it happen because that's what our customers expect. Because we said yes to this opportunity, we can now get new features and updates out much faster to delight our customers and enable new business opportunities.

A tiny but mighty bonus tip: Give praise. This only takes a couple minutes, but it's incredible how many people don't do it. Try it and you will discover the highest benefit to cost ratio you'll ever see. For example, we thank people for every pull request we receive.

When you tell a story, start with appropriate context.
How many times has someone started telling you something and not provided the context? Or come into your office and started in the middle of the problem?
Think of Apple commercials that showed you how to use the iPhone. Ad as tutorial! Then they put up a web page with links to the apps shown. Think of Claude Hopkins, who created the demand for toothpaste.
Define the problem. Things were going great, and then... you hit this problem. Here's how to use our product to solve your problem! Just use the following steps.
When you speak with authenticity, you build brand trust and create a more human experience.

current state, new challenge, retool/adjust, triumph, then new state.
was: got assignment, worked hard to no avail until one day mailed team, because of this success, more success, until published.
what if: was a writer, did normal stuff until one day new thing announced, then retooled and adjusted, until success
was the assignment in 1 or 3? if 1, then what's 3? mailed team?
