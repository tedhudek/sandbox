Today at #writethedocs, I'll talk tips for #techcomm, core principles that have guided me during two decades in the biz, illustrated with real-world stories to show results you can expect. Hope you can make it!

## Who and Why

This talk is for all documentarians, with a slight skew to those newer to the discipline. Basic writing workflow is the only assumed background knowledge. The takeaway is that the writer is more empowered, effective, and has a more enriching career.

## Bio

My name is Ted Hudek, and I've been a tech writer at Microsoft for 19 years. I came to WTD for the first time in 2015, where I was amazed to see a roomful of documentarians and even more amazed to hear about open publishing technologies. The year after, partially due to the exposure at WTD, I became one of the pioneers at Microsoft in implementing open publishing. I then came back to WTD in 2016 and told the story on the first WTD panel discussion. Later in 2016, I was a guest on the Not-Boring Tech Writer podcast hosted by Jacob Moses.
